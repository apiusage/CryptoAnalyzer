Generate a detailed historical table of Bitcoin’s major bull market peaks using on-chain and technical valuation indicators.

The model should automatically detect each major historical market peak (from Bitcoin’s full trading history to present), based on large price reversals (≥ 70% drawdown after top) or known cycle highs.

For each detected cycle peak, include columns:

Cycle (auto-label by year, e.g. “2011”, “2013 (Apr)”, “2013 (Dec)”, “2017”, “2021 (Apr)”, “2021 (Nov)” etc.)
Peak Date (actual top date)
BTC Price (USD)
Pi Cycle Top Value (price when signal triggered)
Puell Multiple
Mayer Multiple
4-Year MA Multiplier
NUPL
MVRV
Days Before/After Actual Peak (difference between Pi-Cycle signal and actual top)
Price Decline After Peak (%)
Notes (short context)

Indicator definitions and thresholds:
Pi Cycle = Short MA × 2 crosses Long MA → historical top signal
Puell > 2 → miner revenue extreme
Mayer > 2 × 200-day MA → overheated
4-Year MA > 3.5 → long-term overbought
NUPL ≥ 0.7 → most holders in profit
MVRV ≥ 3 → high unrealized gains

Use actual or best-estimate values for each metric, referencing public data (Glassnode, LookIntoBitcoin, Bitbo).

Output format:
| Cycle | Peak Date | BTC Price (USD) | Pi Cycle | Puell | Mayer | 4-Yr MA | NUPL | MVRV | Days to Peak | Decline % | Notes |
|:------|:-----------|----------------:|---------:|------:|------:|--------:|------:|------:|--------------:|-----------:|:------|

Then include a Summary Section explaining:
Which indicator predicted peaks most accurately (smallest lead/lag)
Average days between signal and top
Which indicators typically confirm peaks simultaneously

Make sure the model detects all major tops automatically, without being told which years to include, and uses concise, readable numeric results.
